The purpose of this blog is to carry out a personal R & D work focused on the world of data science. **Research** focused on the study and learning in the data analysis, its tools and application areas and tools and, **Development** putting into practice the different concepts studied or analyzed with two goals:

 1.	Learn and strengthen the knowledge
 2.	Share such knowledge and references in case they might be of interest to anyone who could consult them.

Based on my initial experience with *"Data Science"*, the posts of this blog will be structured in the following classification:

 *	**Foundations**: Theoretical explanations and examples of use
 * **Projects**: Analysis of public datasets
 * **Success Stories**: Companies and success cases of application
 *	**Utilities**: Tools and Software applications

 Thus, and arrived at this point, there is no other than ... Start engines.

 Let's begin!!!
