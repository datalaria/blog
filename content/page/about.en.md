Hi to everyone!!, My name is Daniel, a telecommunications engineer with over 10 years of experience in Engineering and R & D projects within a multinational company in the sector.
Passionate about any new technology, tool or system that becomes a reality the impossible, or at least, easier the difficult.

For some time now, I have been embarking on the world of data analysis in its different uses and following the Lord Kevin’s maxim: "If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it".

To this end, I have been studying several MOOCs and programs related to the world of data and now I have extended it with a Master on Big Data and Business Analytics, whose knowledge I expect to continue building through the different articles and projects shared.

Through these articles and the application of the knowledge in different processes of my daily business (currently focused on R + D project management) I hope to learn and improve in this field, as well as help or be useful as much as possible to anyone who gets to read this blog.
If, by chance, you have fallen on this blog, thank you for the time given, and I will be happy to hear any questions, suggestions or improvements to any of the articles published.
