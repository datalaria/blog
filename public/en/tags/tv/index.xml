      <description>Netflix, the king of Video On Demand platforms, represents a clear example of a data-driven company. And the thing is that Netflix, not only has managed to break through and succeed in the film and television industry, but through a disruptive business model and idea has also changed the rules of the game and has revolutionized this entire sector.
