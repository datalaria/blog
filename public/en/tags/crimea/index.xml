      <description>We are opening the Success Stories category with Florence Nightingale (12/05/1920 – 13/08/1910), british nurse, writer and statistician, who is considered the mother of nursing and one of the first data scientist in history.
Her story is especially relevant given that, in addition to fighting for the women’s rights and emancipation through the opening of new qualified professional paths, she stood out in the field of nursing for being considered the precursor of modern professional nursing thanks to the creation of the first conceptual model of nursing.</description>
